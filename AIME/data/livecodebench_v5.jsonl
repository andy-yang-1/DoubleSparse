You need to ensure that the elements in the array are distinct. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\nRemove 3 elements from the beginning of the array. If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.\n\nNote that an empty array is considered to have distinct elements. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7].\nIn the second operation, the next 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [3, 5, 7], which has distinct elements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,4,4]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 4].\nIn the second operation, all remaining elements are removed, resulting in an empty array.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [6,7,8,9]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe array already contains distinct elements. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\nYou will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n", "tests": {"fname": "863.json", "md5": "e856fd5fb652623fa4b1fc50b603e16d"}}
